# Find Couple Game (MVC Architecture)
This is a simple iOS game called "Find Couple" built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. The game involves flipping cards to find matching pairs within a grid of cards. The MVC architecture helps to organize the codebase and separate concerns between the data model, user interface, and game logic.

# Features

Flip cards: Allow the user to flip the cards to reveal the hidden images.<br>
